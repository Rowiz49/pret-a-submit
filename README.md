Prêt-à-Submit is a tool that allows researchers to use their own local LLMs to review their papers against conference's checklists. Each question is answered with **Yes / Partial / No / NA**, accompanied by an explanation — giving reviewers a structured, consistent first-pass assessment.

## Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) **or** Python 3.12+ with [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)
- A running [Ollama](https://ollama.com) instance with at least one model pulled (e.g. `ollama pull llama3`)

---

## Getting Started

### With Docker (recommended)

You may build it locally
```bash
# Build the image
docker build -t pret-a-submit .

# Run (host network is required to reach a local Ollama instance)
docker run --network=host pret-a-submit
```
or pull from the repository
```bash
# Run (host network is required to reach a local Ollama instance)
docker run --network=host ghcr.io/rowiz49/pret-a-submit:latest
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:8965`.

### Local development

```bash
# Install dependencies
uv sync

# Apply migrations
uv run python manage.py migrate

# Create a superuser to access the admin panel
uv run python manage.py createsuperuser

# Start the development server
uv run python manage.py tailwind dev
```

## Configuration

### 1. Set up a Conference and Questions

1. Go to `http://localhost:8965`
2. Create a **Conference** with a name
3. Add **Questions** to the conference — each question has a position (order) and the question text the LLM will answer

### 2. Evaluate a Paper

1. Navigate to the home page
2. Select a conference
3. Enter your Ollama server URL (e.g. `http://localhost:11434`), model name (e.g. `llama3`), and optionally an API key
4. Upload a PDF paper
5. Submit — the app converts the PDF to Markdown, sends it to the LLM with the conference questions, and renders the structured evaluation

## How It Works

```
PDF upload → PyMuPDF → Markdown text
                              ↓
              Ollama prompt with conference questions
                              ↓
              Structured JSON response (position, question, rating, explanation)
                              ↓
              Results page with per-question badges + summary chart
```

The LLM is constrained to reply in a JSON schema derived from a Pydantic model, ensuring parseable, structured output. Ratings are validated and sorted by question position before rendering.
